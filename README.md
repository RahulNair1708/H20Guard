# H20Guard
Water Potability Prediction Using machine Learning and Blockchain Integration

# Abstract
The quality of drinking water is crucial for public health and well-being. Conventional methods for assessing water potability are often resource-intensive and timeconsuming. The H2OGuard project presents a novel approach that leverages machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) algorithms to predict water potability using environmental factors such as pH, turbidity, and chemical contaminants. To enhance data integrity and transparency, blockchain technology is integrated to provide secure and immutable storage of water quality data. This paper discusses the methodologies used, evaluates the performance of various predictive models, and explores the role of blockchain in ensuring data security.

# Algorithms Used
Decision Trees: This model achieved the lowest accuracy at 65%. While it provided some useful insights, it was unable to capture the complexity of the water quality data as effectively as the more advanced models.

DNN with Early Stopping: The Deep Neural Network (DNN) with Early Stopping performed significantly better, reaching an  accuracy of 70%. This indicates its potential in handling more complex relationships in the dataset.

Ensemble Method: The ensemble method showed an accuracy of 67%, combining the outputs of multiple models to improve overall performance. However, it still lagged behind other advanced methods.

Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP): This neural network model reached 69% accuracy, closely following the DNN in performance.

SVM: The Support Vector Machine (SVM) model displayed the lowest accuracy among the advanced models at 59%. Despite being computationally intensive, it struggled with high dimensional data in this particular context.

SVM with Hyperparameter Tuning: After tuning the hyperparameters, the SVM model improved its accuracy to 68%, showcasing the importance of parameter optimization.

XGBoost: The XGBoost model achieved an accuracy of 66%, demonstrating solid performance as a robust gradient boosting algorithm.

XGBoost with Bayesian Optimization: The best-performing model was XGBoost with Bayesian Optimizer, which reached the highest accuracy at 83%. This model excelled due to its ability to fine-tune hyperparameters effectively and capture non-linear patterns in the data.

In summary, XGBoost with Bayesian Optimization provided the best predictive accuracy for water quality prediction, making it the most suitable model for practical deployment in the H2OGuard system, especially when combined with blockchain technology for secure and reliable data management.

# Conclusion
The H2OGuard project successfully demonstrates the immense potential of integrating deep learning models with blockchain technology to create a robust system for predicting and safeguarding water quality data. The Deep Neural Network (DNN) used in the project showed exceptional predictive accuracy, identifying unsafe water conditions with greater precision than traditional machine learning methods. Its ability to model complex relationships among various environmental factors made it an ideal candidate for water potability prediction.In addition to the predictive power of the DNN, blockchain technology played a crucial role in ensuring that the water quality data remained secure, transparent, and immutable. By leveraging a decentralized ledger, the system guaranteed that all stakeholders could access a tamper-proof record of water quality data, fostering greater transparency and trust. The use of smart contracts and role-based access control mechanisms automated key functions, such as data validation and anomaly detection, reducing manual oversight and speeding up the decision-making process.Looking ahead, the H2OGuard system presents a scalable, reliable, and innovative solution that could transform water quality monitoring on a global scale. It has the potential to significantly enhance public health initiatives by offering a realtime, transparent, and trustworthy system for water assessment. However, future iterations of the system may benefit from optimization efforts, such as developing more lightweight models to reduce computational requirements or incorporating advanced blockchain features like sharding to improve scalability. Moreover, expanding the system to integrate additional data sources—such as satellite imagery and enhanced IoT sensors—could further improve its predictive accuracy and applicability. Overall, H2OGuard offers a promising approach to addressing one of the most pressing global challenges ensuring access to clean, safe drinking water for all.
